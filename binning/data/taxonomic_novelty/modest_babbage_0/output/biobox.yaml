    description: >
        Report of statistics for each taxonomic bin at each taxonomic rank that was evaluated.
        Precision measures the purity of each taxonomic bin and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Recall measures the completeness of each taxonmic bin and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Bin sizes are given in absolute numbers of positions (bp).
