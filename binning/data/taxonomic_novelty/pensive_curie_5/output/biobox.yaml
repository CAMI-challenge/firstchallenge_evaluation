    description: >
        Report of statistics for each taxonomic bin at each taxonomic rank that was evaluated.
        Precision measures the purity of each taxonomic bin and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Recall measures the completeness of each taxonmic bin and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Bin sizes are given in absolute numbers of positions (bp).

        Report of macro-recall and truncated macro-precision at each taxonomic rank that was evaluated. [doi://10.1093/bioinformatics/btu745]
        Macro-precision measures the average purity of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%). The 99% cutoff means that only 99% of data (bp) in the largest bins are considered.
        Macro-recall measures the average completeness (recovery) of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Bin sizes are given in absolute numbers of positions (bp).
