##cami_challenge
Taxonomic profiles of the cami challenge for genome abundance, i.e. genome copy numbers. Size of genomes is ignored. 

##cami_challenge_no_circular_elements
Taxonomic profiles of the cami challenge for genome abundance excluding plasmids, viruses and unknown circular elements.

##data_abundance
Taxonomic profiles of the cami challenge for size in base pair of each taxonomic class. Both in absolute numbers (file ending _total), as well as in percent (file ending in _percent). Note that for _total, the column header "Percentage" is not meaningful. One file each included for each sample of the high, medium and low data sets respectively.

##toy_dataset
Taxonomic profiles for genome abundance of the toy dataset. Size of genomes is ignored.
